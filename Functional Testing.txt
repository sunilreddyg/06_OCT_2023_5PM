System testing:-->

		=> System testing is a blackbox testing technique
		=> During system testing separate testing team involve
		   to verify external behaviour of application..

		=> It mainly categorized into two types 
			=> Functioal testing.		[How software is working]
			=> Non functional testing.	[How software is performing]

		Functional Testing:-->
			=> Testers check client important features working
			   with in software.

			=> What is the real purpose of software developed
			   whether it is functioning at end user level is
			   called functional testing.


			Behavioural testing:-->
				During this test QA team verify software
				is responding at end user level.
		
				Tester check availability of screens and
				each screen responding to end customer.

	
				What exactly tester verify during behavioural testing?

					Tester open software and try to access every
					page available at software. If any page does't
					open or failed to access tester report a defect
					to development team

				Mostly what kind of defects come ?

					=> Page not found  [404 Error]
					=> Application server error
					=> Blank pages
					=> Broken links
					=> SQl Connection error

				Note:--> If software break down user not able to access
					software featurs. Testing team suspend 								software testing and ask development team to 							install new software.
					
					ShowStopper Defects:-->
						If there is no work arround to continue
					testing . QA ream report as show stopper defect


			GUI Testing[Graphical user interface testing]:-->
				Testing team verify look and feel of the software.
				
				for Example:-->
					=> Verify background color availability
					=> Verify page alignment at center
					=> Verify margins available at 4 sides
						[Left to right and Top to bottom]
					=> Verify text visibility,font names and font sizes
					
				Note:-->  Tester report GUI defects to development
					  All GUI defects are not high seviority issues
					  mostly it is low seviority issues.
					=> In some softwares GUI testing is a non 
						functional testing.

			InputTesting:-->
				Testing team verify whether softwar is accepting
				all inputs from end user.

				Tester verify sofware is accepting all interactions
				with [Mouse and Keyboard and touch]

				What type of input fields contains softwares:-->
					=> Textbox
					=> Radio Button
					=> Check box
					=> Button
					=> TABS
					=> Dropdown
					=> list of Options 
					=> Comboboxes
					=> Calendar
					=> Auto Complete box
					=> Sorting options
					=> selectables
					=> Drag and Drop

			
			OutputTesting:-->
				Tester operate software with valid inputs
				inorder to verify correctness of output..		


				Note:--> Most of outputs display in text
					format. Also outputs can be 
					validate using object and object behaviour.


				For Example:-->
					When user enter valid mobile number at edit
					field Next button will enabled and ready to click.						Same button disabled when user enter invalid mobile 					number	
			
					
			ErrorTesting:-->
				Tester operate software with invalid inputs in order
				to check software is preventing invalid actions and
				displaying appropriate error information..

				
				For Example:-->
					=> Error message display when user left filling
						important information

					=> Error info display when user attempt invalid 						actions
